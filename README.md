#### Angular Module Federation with Web Components
This repository provides a comprehensive example of setting up module federation for micro-frontends in Angular using web components. Specifically, it demonstrates how to integrate an Angular v14 application into an Angular v12 application seamlessly.

#### Overview
Module Federation allows multiple applications to share code and dependencies at runtime. By combining Angular's module federation with web components, you can integrate applications built with different versions of Angular and ensure smooth interactions between them.

What You'll Learn
Setting Up Module Federation: Learn how to configure Angular applications to use module federation, allowing for dynamic code sharing and integration.
Using Web Components: Understand how to define and use Angular web components for seamless integration across different Angular versions.
Version Compatibility: Explore strategies for integrating applications built with different versions of Angular (v12 and v14) and resolving potential issues.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of Angular and its module federation concept.
Familiarity with web components and their usage in Angular.
Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Module Federation

Follow the instructions in docs/module-federation-setup.md to configure module federation for both Angular v12 and v14 applications.
Build and Serve

Build and serve the Angular v12 application:
bash
Copy code
cd angular-v12-app
ng serve
Build and serve the Angular v14 application:
bash
Copy code
cd angular-v14-app
ng serve
Access the Applications

Access the Angular v12 application at http://localhost:4200
The Angular v14 application should be integrated into the v12 application, demonstrating seamless micro-frontend integration.
