### Angular Module Federation with Web Components
This repository provides an example of setting up module federation for micro-frontends in Angular using web components. Specifically, it demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate an Angular v14 application into an Angular v12 application.

### Overview
Module Federation allows multiple applications to share code and dependencies at runtime. By combining Angular's module federation with web components, you can integrate applications built with different versions of Angular and ensure smooth interactions between them.

### What You'll Learn
- Setting Up Module Federation: Learn how to configure Angular applications to use module federation, allowing for dynamic code sharing and integration.
- Using Web Components: Understand how to define and use Angular web components for seamless integration across different Angular versions.
- Version Compatibility: Explore strategies for integrating applications built with different versions of Angular (v12 and v14) and resolving potential issues.
